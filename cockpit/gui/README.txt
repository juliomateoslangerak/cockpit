This directory contains all of the UI code for the system. All of the 
widgets that are not created by specific devices live here -- the mosaic, 
macro stage view, camera window, etc. Several UI computers automatically 
adjust themselves based on the number and capabilities of the hardware 
available.

 * camera: all code related to the camera views window.
 * dialogs: contains all dialog subclasses and any widgets that are specific
   to them. This includes the experiment setup dialogs.
 * imageViewer: generic code for displaying pixel arrays to the screen. 
 * macroStage: all code related to the macro stage view and experiment 
   histogram.
 * mosaic: all code related to the mosaic viewer.
